  Scenario: Posting a new message
    Given the following posts created at the following times exist in the "master_group":
      | post content |
      | Hey cohorts  |
      | What's up?   |
    When I am on the master_group timeline page
    And I fill in "message" with "Hey Collaborators!"
    And I press "Post"
    Then I should see "Hey Collaborators!"
    
  Scenario: Posting a new message when group name is more than one word
